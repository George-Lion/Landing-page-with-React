## Landing page with React

The landing page is based on react code that allows us to work in sync with each of the files created to shape the web. The components are divided into navbar, jumbotron, cards and footer. For the realization of this project we start as the main base in react, the purpose is to be able to use the different elements of the labels of each component united with the home file that will be the one in charge of rendering them on screen.
